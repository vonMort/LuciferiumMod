        This mod introduces new experimental variations of Luciferium, adding a sense of progression and crafting options:
        
        - **Unstable Luciferium**: An early, unstable version of Luciferium offering basic mechanite enhancements. However, it is unpredictable and less effective compared to its refined counterparts.
        - **Refined Luciferium**: A more advanced and stable version with improved effects, though it still falls short of the perfection of pure Luciferium.
        
        These new additions enhance the risk-reward dynamic of using and producing mechanites, making the mod perfect for players eager to experiment with the dangers and rewards of Luciferium!
