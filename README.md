# Mort's Luciferium

## Overview
Mort's Luciferium adds craftable variants of the powerful drug Luciferium to RimWorld, allowing players to explore the mechanite enhancement path earlier and with more progression options.

## Motivation

Luciferium is one of RimWorld's most intriguing items - a double-edged sword offering incredible benefits with an absolute dependency cost. However, in vanilla gameplay, it remains purely a found or purchased item, with no way to craft it despite its clear mechanical and technological nature.

According to the game's lore:

> *"A concoction of mechanites that dramatically improve the body's functioning in all respects. Over time, it can even heal old scarred-over wounds or brain damage, though it cannot regenerate lost limbs. Unfortunately, without the moderating effects of regular doses every five or six days, the mechanites lose cohesion, causing continuous berserk rages and, eventually, death. After the first dose, there is no way to get the mechanites out, ever. On the urbworlds, they call Luciferium the 'Devil's Bargain'. Many have been forced to kill friends when no more of the seductive red pills could be found."*

Unlike other mods that use plant materials or simple steel to craft Luciferium, this mod takes a more lore-friendly approach. Advanced mechanites would logically require high-tech components like Subcores and Bioferrite - specialized materials that better represent the ultra-tech nature of these microscopic machines. The progression system also reflects the experimental development process that such complex technology would require.

This mod aims to maintain game balance by:
1. Ensuring the crafting costs match the power level of each variant
2. Requiring significant investment in skills and research
3. Preserving the risk/reward dynamic that makes Luciferium interesting

## Features

### New Drug Variants
- **Unstable Luciferium**: An experimental early-game version that provides modest stat improvements at the cost of mental stability. More affordable but less effective than pure Luciferium.
- **Refined Luciferium**: A mid-tier version that offers better enhancements than the unstable variant with reduced mental side effects, bridging the gap to pure Luciferium.

### Crafting
- New drug lab recipes to craft both variants
- Recipe to craft vanilla Luciferium (with appropriate late-game difficulty)
- Balanced resource requirements that scale with the potency of each variant
- Skill requirements that make production viable at different colony development stages

### Balance
All variants maintain the core dependency mechanic of Luciferium - once taken, the user must continue taking the drug or suffer withdrawal symptoms that lead to death. The different variants are balanced to provide a meaningful progression path:
