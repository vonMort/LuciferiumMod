# Mort's Luciferium

## Overview
Mort's Luciferium adds craftable variants of the powerful drug Luciferium to RimWorld, allowing players to explore the mechanite enhancement path earlier and with more progression options.

## Features

### New Drug Variants
- **Unstable Luciferium**: An experimental early-game version that provides modest stat improvements at the cost of mental stability. More affordable but less effective than pure Luciferium.
- **Refined Luciferium**: A mid-tier version that offers better enhancements than the unstable variant with reduced mental side effects, bridging the gap to pure Luciferium.

### Crafting
- New drug lab recipes to craft both variants and even "pure" Luciferium
- Balanced resource requirements that scale with the potency of each variant
- Skill requirements that make production viable at different colony development stages

### Balance
All variants maintain the core dependency mechanic of Luciferium - once taken, the user must continue taking the drug or suffer withdrawal symptoms that lead to death. The different variants are balanced to provide a meaningful progression path:

|                  | Unstable | Refined | Pure (Vanilla) |
|------------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Blood Filtration | +20%     | +45%    | +70%           |
| Consciousness    | +3%      | +4%     | +10%           |
| Moving           | +1%      | +2%     | +5%            |
| Pain Reduction   | ×0.95    | ×0.90   | ×0.80          |
